\chapter{Abstract}

% Acute heart failure is one of the most common reasons for hospitalization due to heart diseases. As patients lifes at the final stages of heart failure depend on receiving a suitable donor heart and the numbers of cases does by far exceed the number of available donor organs, acute heart failure often results in patients death. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have become a common treatment option in patients with heart insufficiency. They provide the ability to assist the patients heart in it's functionality of pumping blood through the circulatory system and thus can prolong a patients time span for proper treatment with a donor heart.
% \\
% The Sputnik VAD is a rotary blood pump that was recently developed by our project partner in Russia. In the course of this work,  first a model representation for the Sputnik LVAD will be developed and the parameters of this model will be identified. The model will then be used to design a current and a speed control. Furthermore, a cascaded flow control is to be designed in order to be able to specify arbitrary flow trajectories. Additionally, different Iterative Learning Controls will be implemented and compared. The control algorithms will be implemented using Matlab and Simulink. Finally, the different control approaches will be evaluated on a cardiovascular simulator developed at MedIT.
