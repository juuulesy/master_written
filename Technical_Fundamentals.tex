\chapter{Technical Fundamentals}
Since the main part of this thesis addresses the implementation of flow control algorithms for a left ventricular assist device, the basics of control theory and a introduction on iterative learning control will be presented here as well.

\section{Control Theory}
Since the field of control theory is very extensive, this section will only deal with the notation and structure of a standard control loop in general. Furthermore, the basic principles of a PI controller and an iterative learning control are discussed, since these are used within pratical part of the thesis.

The basic task of control engineering is to influence a time-varying process from the outside with the goal that the process is executed in a predetermined manner. A control system is characterized in particular by the feedback of the controlled variable to the reference variable. The reference variable represents the state to be achieved.
In theory, this is represented by a control loop with the components shown in \figurename~{\ref{fig:control_loop}}.

The plant $G(s)$ transfers the actuating variable $u(t)$, as well as the influence of the the disturbance $d(t)$, to the controlled variable $y(t)$. This variable is permanently compared with the reference variable $w(t)$ by means of a feedback. Which results in the control error
\begin{equation}
  e(t) = w(t) - y(t)
 \label{eq:e_t}
\end{equation}
The controller $G_{c}(s)$ then transfers the control error to the actuating variable again. The aim of the control loop is to achieve the smallest possible control error with the greatest possible damping. Since these goals contradict each other, a trade off must always be accepted here.\cite{Reg_17}
\\However, there are some general requirements for the closed control loop, which have to be fulfilled. The first of which states that the closed loop needs to be stable. This is the case when the control loop responds to a finite excitation with a finite output signal. The second one is the requirement for disturbance rejection, stating that the controlled variable needs to follow the reference variable asymptotically, so that
\begin{equation}
    \lim\limits_{t \rightarrow \infty}{e(t)} = 0
 \label{eq:lim_e}
\end{equation}
Another requirement is that the dynamic relationship between the reference variable w(t) and the controlled variable y(t) must satisfy specified quality requirements.  The last requirement states that the first three requirements must be statisfied despite uncertainties in the plant. This requirement is called the Robustness requirement. More detailed information on these requirements can be found in \cite{Reg_10}.
\\The plant corresponds to the part of the system in which the physical quantity to be controlled is influenced by the controller. The calculation of the controlled system is only possible in a few cases by setting up and solving differential equations. Due to this, the determination of the characteristic values of the controlled system is usually carried out experimentally. There are several basic types of plants. These are classified according to their dynamic behavior. As only the PT1 element is used in the practical part of this thesis, all other variations will not be discussed at this point. Detailed information on this topic can be found in \cite{Reg_10}. The $PT_{1}$-element is the plant type which is most common in technical equipment.\cite{Reg_10} A $PT_{n}$-element, in it's static state, reacts proportionally to the input value and has a distinct transition behavior. The index n describes the system order.  A PT1 element therefore is a proportional delay element of first order. The time constant T enables an impression of the speed with which the system can react to changes at the input.
